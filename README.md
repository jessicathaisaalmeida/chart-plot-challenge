# JÃ©ssica Thaisa Almeida's Chart Plot Challenge

Created with CodeSandbox

That challenge was very different to me, because I wasn't confortable to REACTjs codding;
That was my first attempt to REACTjs codding, my first time seeing that kind of code. That's why in time of codding I was also learning the language, the patterns, the best practices and the 'aces in the hole'.

Despite not having delivered it on time, I despend some hour getting it better on the weekend, organazing it, in order to give you a nice and easy to maintain solution.

## Dependecies

For this challenge I used some dependencies in order to help and minimize the efforts in some areas.

- `react-ace` and `ace-builds`
  Were used for the input area. With these dependencies I was able to use a ready code interface, with javascript mode and monokai theme;

- `react-chartjs-2` and `chart.js`
  Used for chart plotting. I chose those ones because I'm used to use chart.js with another languages;

- `material-ui/core`
  Used for Material Design interface buttons;

- `json5`
  Used to parse the input stream into an object;

- `react-splitter-layout`
  Used for split panels between editor and chart
